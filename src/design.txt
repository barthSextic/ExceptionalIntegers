MAKE ARRAY LIST

Loop through the String input (ex: 12 23 cat 34 45 dog 56 67)

Make converter method to try and build an /Integer/ object from the string
    Try string object, and try to /parse/ it to an /int/
        If int:
            print primitive int
            return Integer object to main method
        Else :
            throw NumberFormatException to main

Call converter method from main in try - catch block
    If object is built successfully, add to array list
    Else NumberFormatException is caught and outputs message

Example:

> java ExceptionalIntegers 12 23 cat 34 45 dog 56 67
Converter method says integer OK - 12
Converter method says integer OK - 23
Catch block says the argument "cat" is ignored because cat
Converter method says integer OK - 34
Converter method says integer OK - 45
Catch block says the argument "dog" is ignored because dog
Converter method says integer OK - 56
Converter method says integer OK - 67

Vector contents are:
Item 0 is 12
Item 1 is 23
Item 2 is 34
Item 3 is 45
Item 4 is 56
Item 5 is 67
